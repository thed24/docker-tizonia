# Tizonia on Docker container

Containerized [**Tizonia**](http://www.tizonia.org/) cloud music player that uses the host's sound system.

## Audio Output

Tizonia connects as a client directly to the hosts PulseAudio server and uses
its configuration/devices to output the sound. This is achieved by mapping the
UNIX socket used by PulseAudio in the host into the container and configuring
its use.

> Credits: Method borrowed from [docker-pulseaudio-example](https://github.com/thebiggerguy/docker-pulseaudio-example).

## Launch Command

Use the convenience script [docker-tizonia](docker-tizonia).

The script bind mounts the host's '$HOME/.config/tizonia' to make
'tizonia.conf' available inside the container.

> NOTE: The Tizonia process running inside the container needs 'rwx'
> permissions on this directory.

Once the script is in your path, and the permissions of '$HOME/.config/tizonia'
have been changed, just use the usual Tizonia commands:

``` bash

# Change Tizonia's config dir permissions
$ chmod a+wrx $HOME/.config/tizonia

# Install the wrapper script in a location in your PATH
$ sudo install docker-tizonia /usr/local/bin

# Pass the usual Tizonia commands to the wrapper
$ docker-tizonia --youtube-audio-mix-search "Queen Official"

```

## Mac Support

To enable Mac support, please complete the following steps:

### Step 1

It is required that PulseAudio to be installed via `homebrew`
(`brew install pulseaudio`), and the following lines in
`/usr/local/Cellar/pulseaudio/13.0/etc/pulse/default.pa` to be uncommented:

```
load-module module-esound-protocol-tcp
load-module module-native-protocol-tcp
```

### Step 2

To choose the device being used for output, bring up a list of possible output devices and
select one as the default sink:

```bash
pactl list short sinks

pacmd set-default-sink n  # where n is the chosen output number
```

### Step 3

Start the Pulseaudio daemon:

```bash
pulseaudio --load=module-native-protocol-tcp --exit-idle-time=-1 --daemon
```

You should now be able to utilize the `docker-tizonia` script to route audio from the docker
container to the host machine! Please note, this support is no longer being maintained from this repo, please refer to the main repo here:
